                <h1>What is a Congressional District?</h1>
                <p>
                    The United States uses congressional districts for representation in congress. There are 435 seats
                    in the house of representatives and each seat has one representative who represents all of the
                    people that live in that district. Each congressional district represents roughly 747,000 people and
                    this is true across the country. Each time a census done, states can gain and lose the amount of
                    districts based on the population in that state. For example, after the 2010 census, Ohio lost two
                    congressional districts due to population changes in the state.

                    Above is the current congressional district map for the state of Ohio. As you can see, there are 16
                    districts which correspond to the 16 seats that Ohio has.

                    Above is the current 8th congressional district for the state of Ohio. This is the district where
                    Miami University is in and the current representative is Republican Warren Davidson.

                <p>
                    The history of the house of representatives is extensive but it was created to solve the issue of
                    how to fairly represent the citizens of the United States. During the constitutional conventions
                    back in the late 1700's, there was an issue on how the people were to be represented. There were two
                    major plans, the New Jersey plan which constitutes two houses both of which represents the people.
                    The other plan was the Virginia plan which eventually was put into the Constitution. The Virginia
                    plan constitutes a two house system where there is an upper house, the senate, which represents the
                    states and a lower house, the house of representitives, which fairly represents the people.

                <h1>Why do Congressional Districts change?</h1>
                <p>
                    Every ten years, the united states government performs a census that will track population shifts as
                    well as other things. There are two main reasons for a congressional district to change. The reasons
                    are apportionment and balancing of district population.

                <h1>What is Gerrymandering?</h1>
                <p>
                    Gerrymandering, is when politiciance skewthe redistricting process to give themselves (or their
                    political parties) a political advantage over opposing parties. According to Dr. Justin Levitt from
                    the University of Loyola Los Angeles Law School, the different types of advantages that a political
                    party can give itself are cherry-picking voters, eliminating incumbants, eliminating challengers,
                    skewing the representation for a state, diluting minority votes, and splitting communities.

                <h2>Gerrymandering example: Barack Obama 2000</h2>
                <p>
                    A great example of gerrymandering to eliminate a challenger is when Barack Obama made a run for the
                    congressional seat in the 2000 election. Prior to 2000, Obama was a state congressman in Illinois
                    and wanted to run for a federal congressional seat against a four time elected incumbant. Despite
                    putting together a very strong campaign, obama suffered a narrow loss to the incumbant. When the
                    redistricting came after the 2000 census, state and party leaders wanted to secure the incumbants
                    seat against an up and coming young politician like obama so they gerrymandered the district in such
                    a way that forced Obama into a different congressional district. The blue pin on the map above is
                    the location of obama's house and you can notice that the blocks surrounding the house were cropped
                    out into a different district.
